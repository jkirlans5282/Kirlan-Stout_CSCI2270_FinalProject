took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old
mans shoulders they were strange shoulders still powerful although very old and the neck was still
strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen
forward his shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were
faded to many different shades by the sun the  old mans head was very old though and with
his eyes closed there was no life in his face the newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his
arm held it there in the evening breeze he was barefooted
     the boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep
     wake up old man the boy said and put his hand on one of the old mans knees
     the old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away
then he smiled
     what have you got he asked
     supper said the boy were going to have supper
     im not very hungry
     come on and eat you cant fish and not eat
     i have the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it then he started
to fold the blanket
     keep the blanket around you the boy said youll not fish without eating while im alive
     then live a long time and take care of yourself the old man said what are we eating
     black beans and rice fried bananas and some stew
      the boy had brought them in a twodecker metal container from the terrace the two sets
of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set
     who gave this to you
     martin the owner
     i must thank him
     i thanked him already the boy said you dont need to thank him
     ill give him the belly meat of a big fish the old man said has he done this for us more than
once
     i think so
     i must give him something more than the belly meat then he is very thoughtful for us
     he sent two beers
     i like the beer in cans best
     i know but this is in bottles hatuey beer and i take back the bottles
     thats very kind of you the old man said should we eat
     ive been asking you to the boy told him gently i have not wished to open the container
until you were ready
      im ready now the old man said i only needed time to wash
     where did you wash the boy thought the village water supply was two streets down the road
i must have water here for him the boy thought and soap and a good towel why am i so
thoughtless i must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and
another blanket
     your stew is excellent the old man said
     tell me about the baseball the boy asked him
     in the american league it is the yankees as i said the old man said happily
     they lost today the boy told him
     that means nothing the great dimaggio is himself again
     they have other men on the team

philadelphia i must take brooklyn but then i think of dick sisler and those great drives in the old
park
